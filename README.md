## What is it
The CITANZ Mentorship programme matches mentors and mentees, provides guidance and support, and helps manage the mentoring relationship between mentors and mentees, where mentor shares their knowledge, skills and experience to assist mentee to progress in their own careers with agreed goals and bounds.

Mentoring is more than ‘giving advice’, or passing on what their experience was in a particular area or situation. It's about motivating and empowering the mentees to identify their own issues and goals, and helping them to find ways of resolving or reaching them - not by doing it for them, or expecting them to ‘do it the way I did it’, but by understanding and respecting different ways of working[1].

## How it works

3 months fixed term for each mentor/mentee pair

## Nomination Process

### Mentor

Mentor needs to nominiate themselves and which will be reviewed and selected by CITA mentorship team.

### Mentee

Mentee needs to send applications to CITANZ to express their interest for the mentors which published by CITANZ.

## Matching Process

CITANZ mentorship team will help to match the EOI from mentees and the available mentors.

## Review Process

CITANZ mentorship team will **montly** followup with both mentor and mentee to understand the status and provide help and guidance when it is necessary.

## Code of Conduct

All mentors and mentees need to follow the CITANZ's code of conduct, see https://citanz.github.io/society-documentation/Community_Code_of_Conduct.html for more details.

## Cost

There is a small cost for mentees to participate in the Mentorship programme of $29 incl GST for the 3 month programme. This contributes towards the cost of the administration and management of the programme and is subsidised by CITANZ already (the true cost of providing the programme is significantly more).

NOTE: The cost for mentee maybe waived for the first 6 mentrees to prompt the programme.
